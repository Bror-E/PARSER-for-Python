# A python implementation of PARSER: A model for word segmentation. 
For my master thesis I implemented a well known model cogntive model for word segmentation. 
The original model is described  by Pierre Perruchet and Annie Vinter in their paper "PARSER: A Model for Word Segmentation."[1]

Additions to the original model: 
- A method for grammatical induction on the learnt vocabuarly. 
    This method 


Files, folders and their descriptions: 

FOLDERS: 
  PARSER: 
    - Stringdata.py
      Contains methods to extract the data from the string-sets in the DATA folder. 
    - data_handeling.py 
      Contains methods to use the data collected using the Stringdata.py script. 
    - PARSER_class.py
      The PARSER model. Contains methods for training and testing the model.
